# 🏠 Home Price Prediction

A **machine learning project** that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.  
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.



## 📖 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build a **predictive model** that can estimate the selling price of a house based on its characteristics.  
This can be useful for:
- Real estate agencies to provide fair price estimates
- Buyers and sellers to evaluate property value
- Market analysis and investment decisions

The workflow includes:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Building (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Deployment (Optional: Flask Web App / Streamlit)**
